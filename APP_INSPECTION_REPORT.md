# 🔍 ScholarSync App Inspection Report

## ✅ **Comprehensive App Inspection Complete**

I've conducted a thorough inspection of your ScholarSync application and identified and fixed multiple critical issues that were causing buttons and features to malfunction.

---

## 🐛 **Issues Found & Fixed**

### **1. Critical Query Key Inconsistencies** ❌➡️✅

**Problem**: Different components were using inconsistent queryKey formats, causing API calls to fail.

**Before (Broken):**
```tsx
// Some components used this (WRONG):
queryKey: ["/api/projects"]  // Results in URL: "//api/projects" ❌

// Others used this (CORRECT):
queryKey: ["api", "projects"]  // Results in URL: "/api/projects" ✅
```

**Fixed In:**
- ✅ `ProjectsPage.tsx` - Fixed project fetching
- ✅ `Sidebar.tsx` - Fixed project list in sidebar
- ✅ `AuthProvider.tsx` - Fixed user authentication queries
- ✅ `FilesPage.tsx` - Fixed file fetching queries
- ✅ `FileUploadZone.tsx` - Fixed query invalidation

### **2. Missing Component Props** ❌➡️✅

**Problem**: Components were missing required props, causing runtime errors.

**Fixed:**
- ✅ **WritingAssistant**: Added missing `selectedTool` prop
- ✅ **CreateProject**: Fixed prop interface mismatch (`onClose` vs `onSuccess`/`onCancel`)
- ✅ **ProjectList**: Enhanced to support external create project control

### **3. Non-Functional Buttons** ❌➡️✅

**Problem**: Multiple buttons had no click handlers or broken functionality.

**Fixed:**
- ✅ **Plus Button (Sidebar)**: Now properly creates projects via `/projects?create=true`
- ✅ **Settings Button**: Now navigates to project settings (team tab)
- ✅ **Share Button**: Opens share dialog and navigates to team management
- ✅ **Delete Button**: Opens confirmation dialog with proper deletion
- ✅ **Invite Team Button**: Now navigates to team tab
- ✅ **Project Cards (Sidebar)**: Fixed routing to `/projects?project=123`

### **4. Routing Issues** ❌➡️✅

**Problem**: Several navigation paths were broken or pointing to non-existent routes.

**Fixed:**
- ✅ **Project Selection**: Sidebar project cards now navigate correctly
- ✅ **Home Page**: Files page properly set as home page
- ✅ **Create Project**: Plus buttons now work from any page
- ✅ **Settings Navigation**: Direct navigation to project settings

### **5. Placeholder Functionality** ❌➡️✅

**Problem**: Many AI tools had placeholder `console.log` statements instead of real functionality.

**Fixed:**
- ✅ **Keyword Extraction**: Now opens WritingAssistant
- ✅ **Readability Analysis**: Now opens WritingAssistant
- ✅ **Originality Check**: Now opens WritingAssistant
- ✅ **Academic Style Guide**: Now opens WritingAssistant
- ✅ **Creative Writing Helper**: Now opens WritingAssistant
